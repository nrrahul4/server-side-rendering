# Server side rendering example application

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This application is an example for server side rendering app. Here I have used React JS, Express and styled components.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run server`

Runs the application in SSR mode.

Open http://localhost:8080 to view it in browser

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
